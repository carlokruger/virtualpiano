# Virtual Piano

## Stage 1/5: Add markup
### Description

To go through the first step, change the page title.

The <kbd> tag is used to denote the text to be typed on the keyboard or for a key name (you can read more about it [on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd)). Use this paired tag in the body of the document to specify seven keys on the keyboard: clicking these will eventually create charming sounds of your instrument. You must have the symbols A, S, D, F, G, H and J placed in this tag. These will be the white keys on the piano.

If you open this HTML file in your browser, you'll see the names of the keyboard keys. These keys do not make sounds yet, but you're one step closer to creating a working virtual piano.

### Objectives

Change the page title.

Add 7 <kbd> tags to the document body. In each of them enclose one of the symbols: A, S, D, F, G, H or J.

### Examples

#### Example 1: In the browser, the result of this step will look like this:
